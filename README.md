# Atrrition_Edge
AttritionEdge is a Java-based system that identifies early signs of customer churn by monitoring engagement decline. It analyzes user behavior such as activity frequency, feature usage, and inactivity duration to compute an attrition risk score, flag high-risk users, and generate analytical reports using object-oriented, rule-based decision logic.
